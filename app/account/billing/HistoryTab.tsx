  // ── Why this isn't a UNION of the two tables ───────────────────────────────
  //
  // One £1.50 top-up writes TWO rows (see grantTopUpCredit in
  // app/api/stripe/webhook/route.ts, where the write order is load-bearing):
  //
  //   topup_purchases  the idempotency gate, keyed on stripe_payment_intent_id
  //   invoices         the local mirror, type='topup', carrying stripe_charge_id
  //
  // They share no identifier — a PaymentIntent and a Charge are different Stripe
  // objects — so there is nothing to join on. Listing both tables naively
  // double-lists every top-up.
  //
  // So `invoices` is the ledger. It already holds subscription charges
  // (type='card'), school invoices (type='school') AND top-ups, which makes it
  // the complete record of money moved; the credit quantity a teacher wants is
  // derivable from amount_gbp without reading topup_purchases at all.
  //
  // EXCEPT that the mirror is best-effort: it logs and swallows its own failure,
  // because by that point the credit is already granted and a webhook retry
  // would hit the idempotency gate and skip the grant. So a purchase CAN exist
  // with no invoice. Rather than silently hide a payment, an unmatched purchase
  // is listed too.
