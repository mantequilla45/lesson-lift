 * The credit packs the signed-in teacher may buy, in display order.

 * Read straight from topup_packs in the browser: the read policy is
 * `active or is_admin()` and `select` is granted to `authenticated`, so a
 * teacher can list active packs under RLS with no route of its own.
 *
 * `available_to` is filtered HERE for display only. It is not enforced by RLS,
 * so /api/stripe/topup re-checks it before creating a session — see the note in
 * topup-packs.ts. Never treat this list as the authority on what may be bought.
