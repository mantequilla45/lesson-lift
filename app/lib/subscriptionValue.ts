// What a subscription is actually worth per month.
//
// Kept pure and separate from the Stripe call so it can be tested against real
// payloads without the network. Everything here works in MINOR units (pence),
// the way Stripe reports money, and converts to major only at the edge.
//
// THE THREE THINGS THAT MADE THE OLD FIGURE WRONG
//
// 1. Discounts. Checkout sets allow_promotion_codes and nothing persists what
//    was actually charged. Two live production subscribers list at £7.99 and
//    are billed £0.08 and £0.80 — a 27x overstatement across the pair.
// 2. Interval. An annual subscriber was counted at the monthly price. A year's
//    money divided by twelve is the monthly figure; anything else double counts
//    or undercounts depending on which way it is read.
// 3. Currency. Both live subscriptions carry presentment_currency 'php' while
//    being denominated in GBP. Every column we store is named *_gbp, so a
//    subscription genuinely denominated in something else must not be silently
//    added to a pounds total.
//
// No "use client" and no imports: safe from either side, and unit testable.
