//
// V2 renames every tool to the shortest thing a teacher would actually say:
// "Slideshow Generator" becomes "Slides", "Worksheet Generator" becomes
// "Worksheets". The old names are NOT deleted — they stay on `Tool.label`
// (which the signed-in app still renders) and are repeated in `synonyms` so
// search keeps matching them. Someone arriving from Google on "worksheet
// generator" has to land on Worksheets, and that is expected to stay true for
// at least a year.
//
// This lives beside TOOLS rather than inside it so the 35 entries above keep
// exactly the shape the dashboard already reads.
