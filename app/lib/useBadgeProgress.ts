/*
 * Streak, level and badges, for every surface that shows them.
 *
 * Three components need this at once (Today's metrics, the sidebar level box,
 * the profile header and collection) and they are siblings, so this is a
 * module-level store rather than per-component state: one load, one evaluation,
 * one claim, however many mount. Same shape as useProfileIdentity and
 * usePinnedTools, and useSyncExternalStore for the same reasons — SSR-safe
 * reads, no setState in an effect, and every consumer updates together.
 *
 * It also owns the run history, which Today and the profile header each used to
 * fetch for themselves. Both now read it from here, so this removes a duplicate
 * query rather than adding a third.
 *
 * The claim is deliberately quiet. Evaluation is free (a few passes over rows
 * already in memory), but the RPC only fires when the evaluation turns up
 * something not already held, so a teacher who has earned nothing new since
 * their last visit makes zero writes.
