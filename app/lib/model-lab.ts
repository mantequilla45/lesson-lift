// Admin-only per-request model override, for the model lab (/admin/model-lab).
//
// The lab exists to answer "does this tool still produce good work on a cheaper
// model, and what does it actually cost?" — which means running the SAME input
// through several models and comparing. That only tells the truth if it goes
// through the tool's real route with the tool's real prompt, so rather than
// duplicating prompt-building into a separate lab endpoint, each route accepts
// an optional override in its request body.
//
// ── WHY THIS IS SAFE ──
// The override is honoured ONLY when the caller is a verified admin. A teacher
// posting `__labModel` gets it ignored entirely and their generation runs on the
// configured model exactly as before. The admin check is a real auth call
// (getUser + profiles.is_admin), not a header or a client assertion.
//
// ── WHY LAB RUNS STILL RECORD COST ──
// They spend real money, so they write a real token_usage row. What they do NOT
// do is masquerade as teacher usage: the row carries step='model-lab', which the
// existing admin_tool_step_breakdown() already groups by, so lab spend is
// visible in totals but separable from a tool's genuine per-run cost.
