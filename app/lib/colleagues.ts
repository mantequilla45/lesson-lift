 *
 * Unlike every other data module here, this one is not purely RLS-scoped reads.
 * Three of its calls are security definer RPCs, because three of the questions
 * this feature asks are about ANOTHER teacher's data: who exists, what have they
 * made, and may I write to them. RLS can express "my own rows" and nothing else,
 * and every policy that would answer those questions instead would also expose
 * resource bodies. The migration header sets out the reasoning per function.
 *
 * Follows userBadges.ts rather than folders.ts on failure: a missing table or
 * function returns an empty result instead of throwing. This ships before the
 * migration is applied by hand, and a throw on the Colleagues page mount would
 * take the screen down over a feature that has no data yet anyway.
