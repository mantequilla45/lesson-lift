// Every name here matches what the real call site passes — see the trigger
// routes listed against each entry — so a preview exercises the same branches
// the live email will. Where a template changes shape depending on a parameter
// (teacher_invite reads differently with and without an inviter name), the
// sample fills it in, because the populated branch is the one that actually
// goes out.
//
// The values are deliberately obvious fakes. An admin looking at a preview
// should never be left wondering whether they are looking at a real teacher's
// details or an email that has already been sent.
