// Fixed sample inputs for the model lab.
//
// The point of a fixed input is comparability: the same prompt run on two
// models is the only way to judge whether the cheaper one is good enough. These
// are deliberately realistic — a real trip letter, a real set of pupil targets —
// because a toy input ("write about dogs") flatters every model equally and
// tells you nothing about the tools teachers actually use.
//
// Each body matches its route's request interface exactly. The lab adds
// __labModel / __labEffort / __labVerbosity on top before posting.
//
// Coverage is chosen to span the range where terra's economics flip: short
// output (letter-writer, 2k) through to the longest (lesson-planner, 8k).
