/**
 * What the paying teachers are ACTUALLY billed each month, read live from
 * Stripe.
 *
 * The SQL figure (teacher_mrr) can only report list prices: nothing in our
 * database records what a subscription is really charged. Checkout allows
 * promotion codes, and on production both live subscribers are on heavy ones —
 * listed at GBP 7.99, billed GBP 0.08 and GBP 0.80. No amount of fixing the
 * query reaches that; only Stripe knows.
 *
 * WHY THIS TAKES A LIST OF SUBSCRIPTION IDS
 *
 * An earlier version summed every `active` subscription on the account. That
 * made the dashboard incoherent, because the tiles beside the headline count a
 * different population: on staging it read GBP 46.95 next to "1 paying teacher"
 * and "GBP 7.99 cancelling". Of the five active subscriptions there, two belong
 * to staff accounts, one to the cancelling teacher, one to no profile at all,
 * and one teacher holds two.
 *
 * So the caller passes exactly the subscriptions teacher_mrr() counted, and
 * this sums those. The headline and the tiles then describe the same people by
 * construction rather than by coincidence.
 *
 * FAILURE POSTURE
 *
 * Never throws. On any failure the caller falls back to the SQL figure and says
 * so on screen. An admin dashboard that renders a slightly rougher number is
 * much better than one that 500s because Stripe is having a bad afternoon.
