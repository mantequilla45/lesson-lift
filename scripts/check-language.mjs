/**
 * Two brand rules, enforced rather than remembered.
 *
 *   1. No em dashes or en dashes in user-facing strings. Use a full stop, a
 *      colon or a comma. They are inconsistently rendered, they encourage
 *      sentences that should have been two, and they are not how the product
 *      talks.
 *
 *   2. No "AI" anywhere a teacher can see. Not in tool names, buttons, empty
 *      states or marketing. The product is judged on what it hands back, and
 *      leading with the technology invites the reader to judge the technology
 *      instead. Allowed only in the terms, the privacy policy and school
 *      procurement documents, where it is a factual disclosure.
 *
 * Scope is deliberately narrow: the marketing surfaces and the shared copy
 * table, which is what a visitor and a signed-out teacher actually read. The
 * signed-in app still carries both, and widening this to `app/**` would fail on
 * roughly a hundred pre-existing strings that are a separate piece of work.
 *
 * Run by `pnpm lint`.
