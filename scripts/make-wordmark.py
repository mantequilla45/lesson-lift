"""Generate PNG exports of the Jooma wordmark.

Run:  python scripts/make-wordmark.py

Writes, at three heights each:

    public/logo/Jooma-logo-v2-{h}.png         purple on transparent
    public/logo/Jooma-logo-v2-white-{h}.png   white on transparent, for deep purple

and the same wordmark as a round badge, to sit alongside the J icon:

    public/logo/Jooma-logo-v2-round-{n}.png        white on a purple disc
    public/logo/Jooma-logo-v2-round-light-{n}.png  purple on a white disc

The source is app/components/v2/Wordmark.tsx, NOT public/logo/logo-v2.svg.
Those two marks differ: the SVG sets "ooma" in ink and only the j in purple,
whereas the component inherits `currentColor` and the nav paints it entirely
--j-purple. The all-purple lockup in the nav is the one people mean by "the
Jooma logo", so that is what this renders.

Notes for anyone editing this:

  1. The component's paths live inside `translate(65,745) scale(1,-1)`, so the
     glyphs are stored upside down and are flipped on render. Each path after
     the first carries its own `translate(x,0)` for letter placement. Both
     transforms are applied here; the numbers are read out of the TSX rather
     than duplicated, so moving a letter in the component moves it here too.

  2. Letters are filled NONZERO, the SVG default, via fill_nonzero below.
     Pillow's polygon fill is not good enough here: the m and a each have an
     outline that doubles back on itself, and a plain scanline fill left a
     triangular notch in both shoulders of the m and in the bowl of the a.

  3. Same supersample-and-downsample approach as make-favicon.py, since Pillow
     has no antialiased polygon fill.

Dependencies: Pillow only, as with make-favicon.py.
