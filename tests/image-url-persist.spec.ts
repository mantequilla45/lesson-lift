/*
 * Does an image added by URL actually survive a reload?
 *
 * "Add by URL" goes through /api/fetch-image, which returns the bytes as a
 * base64 data URL. That string is then inlined into the slide JSON and saved
 * with the rest of the deck, so the question is not really about images at all:
 * it is whether a row carrying an inlined image still writes.
 *
 * The deck is created and read back through the service role, but the editing
 * happens in a real browser as a real signed-in teacher, so what is asserted is
 * what a teacher would actually get.
