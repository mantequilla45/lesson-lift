 * The sidebar credit meter.
 *
 * The bug this pins: useCreditMeter used `metered: false` for two different
 * things — "this plan has no credit ceiling" and "the lookup failed" — and the
 * sidebar renders the block only when `metered` is true. So one flaky request
 * out of the four getEntitlements() makes deleted a teacher's credits
 * mid-session, which reads as having lost them.
