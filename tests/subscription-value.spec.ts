/*
 * What a subscription is really worth per month.
 *
 * This is the one part of honest MRR that cannot be asserted end to end: the
 * true amounts live in Stripe, and a live total changes whenever somebody
 * subscribes. So the arithmetic is pulled out into a pure function and tested
 * against fixtures here, with the live call kept thin around it.
 *
 * The fixtures are not invented. They are the shapes actually found on the
 * production account: a GBP 7.99 monthly price carrying a promotion code that
 * reduced the charge to GBP 0.08 and GBP 0.80, and a presentment currency of
 * PHP on a subscription denominated in GBP.
