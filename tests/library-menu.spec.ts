/*
 * Can you actually click the Library's "..." menu?
 *
 * In grid view you could not. The menu rendered, but underneath the cards to
 * its right and below, so every item in it was unclickable. Two stacking
 * contexts caused it, and both had to go:
 *
 *   - `.filecard:hover` applies transform: translateY(-3px), and a non-none
 *     transform creates a stacking context that traps the panel inside the
 *     card. You are always hovering the card whose kebab you just clicked.
 *   - the menu's wrapper carried `position: absolute; z-index: 2`, which
 *     clamped the panel's own z-index: 30 to an effective 2.
 *
 * THE ASSERTION HAS TO BE A HIT TEST. Checking the panel's computed z-index
 * would have passed the whole time it was broken: the value was always 30, it
 * simply meant nothing inside those contexts. What matters is whether the
 * pixels a teacher aims at belong to the menu, so that is what is measured —
 * elementFromPoint at the centre of a menu item, plus a real click.
