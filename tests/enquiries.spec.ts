 * The property worth pinning is that /contact works with NO SESSION AT ALL. It
 * is the first unauthenticated write in the product, so the two ways it can
 * regress are both invisible to a typecheck: dropping /contact or
 * /api/enquiries out of PUBLIC_PATHS in proxy.ts bounces a school to /login, and
 * tightening the grants on `enquiries` past the point submit_enquiry() needs
 * makes the POST fail for anon only. Neither shows up signed in, which is how
 * they would reach production.
 *
 * Rows are read back through the SERVICE ROLE rather than the admin console:
 * these tests assert that the submission landed and what it contains, and doing
 * that through a second UI would make a failure ambiguous between the two.
 * app/admin/enquiries has its own coverage in the last test.
