/*
 * Does MRR report money that is actually arriving?
 *
 * It used to be count(plan <> 'free') x plan_config.price_monthly, which reads
 * no Stripe state at all. Three ways that overstated, all measured rather than
 * imagined:
 *
 *   1. Comps. An admin granting Pro writes plan='pro' and fakes
 *      subscription_status='active' with no card on file. On production, 1 of
 *      the 3 Pro profiles was one of these, counted at a full GBP 7.99.
 *   2. Cancellations. A teacher who has cancelled keeps the plan and the status
 *      until the period ends. On production BOTH live subscriptions were in
 *      this state.
 *   3. Discounts. The two live subscribers list at GBP 7.99 and are billed
 *      GBP 0.08 and GBP 0.80.
 *
 * 1 and 2 are answerable from our own columns and are what these tests cover.
 * 3 needs Stripe, and its arithmetic is unit tested in isolation because a live
 * total cannot be asserted against a fixture.
 *
 * `stripe_subscription_id IS NULL` is the discriminator for a comp. Not
 * subscription_status, which a comp sets to 'active' by hand.
